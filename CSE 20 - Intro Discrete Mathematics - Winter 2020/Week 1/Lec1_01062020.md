An algorithm is a __finite__ sequence of __precise__ instructions for __correctly__ performing a computation or for solving a problem.

Question you need to ask about your algorithm:

1. Is my algorithm well-defined / definite?

2. Will I stop after a finite amount of steps?

3. Is the answer (output) correct?

Think of algorithms as a blackbox.
