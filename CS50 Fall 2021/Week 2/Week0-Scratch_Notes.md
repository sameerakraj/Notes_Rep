# Week 0 - Scratch NOTES

Computer programming = solving problems

input  -->  [____]  -->  output

Computers speak only one language, binary.

Binary    Decimal  
000         0  
001         1  
010         2  
011         3  
100         4  
101         5  
110         6  
111         7  

100       10        1  
10^2      10^1      10^0  <-- powers of 10  (hence, "decimal system")
1         2         3     = 10^2*1 + 10^1*2 + 10^0*3 = 100 + 20 + 3 = 123

4         2         1  
2^2       2^1       2^0  -> powers of 2 ("binary system")
\#        \#        \#

A = 65 = 0100 0001
B = 66 = 0100 0010

Assignments are context dependent.

ASCII chart --> mapping.

e.g.   H     I     \!  
      72     73    33

1 byte = 8 bits

"scheme" => e.g. RGB

Pixel is a dot on the screen.

input  =>  [algorithm]  => output

"algorithm": step-by-step instructions for solving some problem.

"pseudocode": an artificial and informal language that helps programmers develop
algorithms. A "text-based" detail (algorithmic) design tool.

"abstraction": breaking a larger problem down into smaller, easier to deal with problems. Abstraction is implemented via functions.

"functions": actions or verbs that solve some smaller problem / a piece of the puzzle.
You might use a whole bunch of functions to solve a bigger problem.

"conditionals": things that you do conditionally based on the answer to some question

"boolean expressions": expressions that simply have yes (true) or no (false) answers

"loops": some kind of directive that tells us to do something again and again

Sprites --> characters

"abstraction" leads to better:
1. readability
2. maintainability

"reusable code": reuse the code that you wrote, reuse the sprites that you wrote.
Leads to code correctness and a better design. In the demonstration, it was the same
piece of trash being re-positioned to the top of the window and allowed to 'fall'.
